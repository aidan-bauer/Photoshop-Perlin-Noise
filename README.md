# Photoshop-Perlin-Noise
While Photoshop has several noise effects, it lacks a quick, easy way to create Perlin noise. Perlin noise is an algorithm for creating pseudorandom noise and has many applications, including procedurally generating realistically looking terrain formations in video games. Since it is so commonly used nowadays, it seemed a shame that Photoshop didn't have a way to generate Perlin noise, so this is my attempt to remedy that.

My perlin noise function is taken from Joseph Gentile's adaptation of Stephan Gustavson's perlin noise example. The original code can be found <a href="https://github.com/josephg/noisejs">here</a>.
